I was Thinking how much time i already dedicated to learning Information Technologies, and i decided to build an application which tracks my time and saves it. there were many ways to achieve this, like: using cloud native apps but i decided to go simpler and track info in the csv file locally. 

it would be pretty frustrating to every time open code directory and run code, so i turned it into executable binary using go build, added in Global PATH and i just need to refer it by name timetracker.
